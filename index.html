      <p>Lorem ipsum...Just kidding!!!  Now for the wikipedia like description:</p>
      <p>Timothy Shaffer; born January 6, 1968, is a Software Engineer who has worked 29 years in the Healthcare Software Industry.  Shaffer most recently worked for Cerner but his
        most notable stints came with Siemens Health Services and Shared Medical Systems (SMS). (They all were actually the same company...Siemens purchased SMS and then sold to Cerner)
        Shaffer worked on software solutions that would allow the different areas and systems within the hospital environment to communicate or interface seamlessly with each other.  He 
        also helped clients in generating files or interface transactions that were used by areas outside of the hospital and most recently helped Good Shepherd Rehabillitation in Allentown 
        save millions of dollars in fines by generating files to report data to the Pennsylvania state agency.</p>
      <p>More in my own words...</p>
      <p>I am married to the woman in the photo, Maureen, and that is an example of how we are together, having a good time at Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville in Universal Studios Orlando, Florida.  
        I have 2 sons, Thomas (26) and Johnathon (23) and 2 step-sons, Connor (22) and Logan (18).  Maureen and I have a Shih Tzu named Isaac that will probably make an appearance or two on 
        my lap during classes. </p>
